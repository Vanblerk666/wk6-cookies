Challenges I overcame:

- Github. Wasted more time on the least useable thing on t'internet. a proper ballsache.
- Hubris; I had a basic version working by Thursday night and attempted to build a shop component pulling in data from an array to build buttons dynamically. it was a few steps too far for my abilities, but i learned stuff in my fail. Techeds staff recommened a simpler version than my figma plan, so I abandoned this bit.
- css challenge - i spent a lot of time using css to fix a slight non centering of an image. TechEds staff told me it was difficult, but I did it.

i did learn a lot though!
